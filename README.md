# TuneUtils
A set of quick web tools that add some much-needed functionality to the Spotify user experience

## Features
- **Recently played** displays your 20 most recently played songs on Spotify and lets you hear samples of each, so you can find the a song you liked but didn't see the name of while it was playing.
- (Coming soon) **Sort by sound** allows you to sort the tunes in your playlist by the actual sound qualities of the song, including tempo, acousticness, danceability, etc. as provided by Spotify's audio analysis, so you can gain a new perspective about the songs you listen to.
- **Quick cover** lets you upload a cover and descriptions to any of your playlists from a neat web interface instead of being required to do it via the desktop app, allowing you to personalize your lists to your heart's content from anywhere with an internet connection.
- (Coming soon) **Tunealytics** uses sound qualities of the songs within your playlists to help you find trends among the music you like. You can also compare your results with a friend's playlist.
